Book Review API ðŸ“š

Description:
Build an API where users can add books, submit reviews, and see average ratings for each book.

Core Features:

Users: Register & login (basic authentication or JWT).

Books: CRUD endpoints (add, update, delete, list books).

Reviews: Users can add reviews & ratings for a book.

Rating Aggregation: Show average rating per book.

Why itâ€™s good for beginners:

Covers all CRUD operations on multiple models (Users, Books, Reviews).

Introduces relationships (one-to-many: Book â†’ Reviews).

Gives practice with authentication/authorization.

Teaches response models and validation with Pydantic.

Expandable â€” you can later add search, pagination, or a frontend.

Optional Add-ons:

File upload (cover image for books).

Sorting/filtering by rating or genre.

Swagger docs customization.
